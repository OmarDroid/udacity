# The Movies App
This is the stage 1 of the Movies app made for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), it uses [The Movies Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

## Setting it up with your own API KEY
Add it in gradle.properties

``` groovy
API_KEY = ""
```

### For now I'm just using [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) an image downloading and caching library
